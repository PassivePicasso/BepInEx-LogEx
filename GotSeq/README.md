## GotSeq?

GotSeq is a patcher time mod for BepInEx which forward's bepinex log messages to a locally hosted Seq.NET instance on port 5341

This is primarily intended to provide the ability to create alternative log display systems for bepinex.

Go to Http://GetSeq.net/ to acquire a Single-User license copy of Seq.NET to setup as a local server, installation is an easy next next next wizard, simply use all defaults.

Go to the GitHub for a special Risk of Rain Seq.NET Theme! appliable in the Settings > Instance menu!

If you know how to work your way around RoR2 Mod development, find the RiskofRainFont file in and install it for special font support.
