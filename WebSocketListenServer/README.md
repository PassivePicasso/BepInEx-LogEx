## WebSocket Log Listen Server

This is a patcher time mod for BepInEx which provides a simple WebSocket Server that forward's 
bepinex log messages to connected WebSockets on the local machine.

This is primarily intended to provide the ability to create alternative log display systems for bepinex.
